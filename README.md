# AI Roast Machine

AI Roast Machine is a playful web app that uses state-of-the-art AI models to generate witty, lighthearted "roasts" based on user-uploaded or camera-captured photos. Users can select their preferred AI model, adjust roast intensity, and even listen to the roast via text-to-speech—all in a modern, privacy-friendly interface.

## Key Features

- **Photo Upload & Camera Support:** Upload an image or snap a photo directly from your device.
- **Model Selection:** Choose from multiple AI models (GPT-4.1, Gemini, Grok) for different roast styles.
- **Roast Intensity:** Adjust how spicy or gentle the roast should be (1–10 scale).
- **AI-Powered Roasting:** Get a creative, funny roast generated by advanced AI vision models.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Listen to your roast with high-quality voice synthesis.
- **Modern UI:** Built with Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui for a responsive, accessible experience.
- **Privacy-First:** No images are stored; all processing is ephemeral.

  - `/api/tts`: Converts roast text to speech using ElevenLabs.

## Dependencies

- **Core:**
  - [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/)
  - [React 19](https://react.dev/)
  - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
  - [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

## Running Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for unit and integration testing.

### Running the Test Suite

To run all tests:

```bash
npm test
# or
yarn test
# or
pnpm test
```

Test files are located in a parallel `tests/` directory that mirrors the structure of the `src/` folder:
- `tests/app/api/`: API route tests
- `tests/components/`: Component tests

### Writing Tests

- Place new test files in the appropriate location in the `tests/` directory.
- Tests should mirror the structure of the `src/` directory (e.g., `src/app/api/example/route.ts` → `tests/app/api/example/route.test.ts`).
- Use Jest and React Testing Library APIs for assertions and rendering React components.

### Coverage

To generate a code coverage report:

```bash
npm test -- --coverage
```

The coverage report will be output in the `coverage/` directory.

### Explanations & Best Practices

- **Why OpenRouter & ElevenLabs?**  
  OpenRouter enables access to multiple vision-capable AI models. ElevenLabs provides high-quality, realistic TTS voices.
